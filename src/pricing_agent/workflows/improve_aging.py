"""Improve Aging Inventory — orchestration engine. Phase 5.

**Not a fourth skill.** This coordinates the three existing skills in dependency order,
ranks and filters their results, and consolidates them into one dealer action plan. It adds
no valuation, forecasting, or promotion arithmetic of its own — every figure it presents was
produced by a skill and is carried through with the `request_id` and `simulation_id` that
produced it.

Sequence (recorded in an ordered execution trace):

    1. PORTFOLIO_FORECAST        run once
    2. CANDIDATE_SELECTION        rank/filter the portfolio result
    3. SINGLE_VEHICLE_VALUATION   only for selected candidates
    4. PROMOTION_PLAN             only when a real calendar event is resolved
    5. CONSOLIDATE                group actions, place figures side by side

The one rule that shapes everything: each skill runs its own simulation with its own
`simulation_id`, and percentiles from different simulations describe different probability
spaces. This engine therefore never sums or averages a percentile across skills. Portfolio-
level joint figures (ending inventory, target probability, joint gross/holding/depreciation
impact) come from a **single** source — the promotion planner's simulation — and are marked
unavailable when no event was run.
