# Internal Used Vehicle Pricing and Inventory Optimization Agent

## 1. Document Overview

### 1.1 Product name

**Internal Used Vehicle Pricing and Inventory Optimization Agent**

### 1.2 Product vision

Build an internal AI agent that helps used-vehicle dealers make explainable, financially responsible pricing and inventory decisions.

The agent converts natural-language requests into validated structured data, retrieves authorized market and inventory information through a vAuto MCP integration, invokes deterministic valuation and forecasting services, and returns:

* single-vehicle valuation
* pricing recommendations
* promotional headroom
* P50 and P90 sales forecasts
* break-even analysis
* holding-cost and depreciation exposure
* portfolio valuation
* one-month and three-month sales forecasts
* event promotion plans
* inventory-capacity recommendations
* warning flags, approvals, and audit records

The agent must support decision-making but must never automatically publish a vehicle price.

---

# 2. Business Problem

Used-vehicle pricing decisions require dealers to balance several competing objectives:

* protect front-end gross
* price vehicles competitively
* reduce days in inventory
* avoid future depreciation
* control floorplan and holding costs
* maintain available inventory slots
* prepare for inbound vehicles
* create discount room for sale events
* avoid pricing below break-even
* maximize portfolio-level economic value

A dealer may be able to list a vehicle at a higher price and earn more nominal gross, but that price may:

* increase expected days to sale
* increase holding costs
* increase depreciation exposure
* consume limited inventory capacity
* create a poor-deal market position
* reduce shopper conversion
* prevent the dealer from acquiring more productive inventory

The product must therefore evaluate both:

1. **Vehicle-level economics**
2. **Portfolio-level inventory economics**

---

# 4. Core Product Principles

## 4.1 LLM as orchestrator, not pricing engine

The LLM may:

* understand natural language
* extract structured data
* identify missing or ambiguous information
* select MCP tools
* coordinate workflows
* explain calculations
* summarize risks and trade-offs

The LLM must not independently generate:

* vehicle valuation
* recommended numerical price
* days-to-sale forecast
* depreciation forecast
* holding cost
* break-even value
* portfolio revenue forecast

All numerical outputs must come from deterministic services, configured simulation models, or validated predictive models.

## 4.2 Structured data before tool execution

No valuation or pricing tool may be called directly from unvalidated free text.
The agent must first produce a validated JSON request.

## 4.3 Human-in-the-loop

The agent may recommend a price or promotion plan, but it must not:

* publish a price
* activate a promotion
* commit inventory
* approve a below-floor sale

without explicit user approval and any required manager approval.

## 4.4 Explainability

Every recommendation must preserve:

* source data
* comparable vehicles
* calculation breakdown
* assumptions
* confidence
* model version
* data timestamps
* warning flags
* approval requirements

## 4.5 Financial safety

The system must protect configurable hard price floors.
Below-floor pricing is allowed only through a documented loss-minimization exception workflow.

## 4.6 Portfolio awareness

The product must not optimize one vehicle while ignoring:

* lot capacity
* inbound vehicles
* duplicate inventory
* replacement opportunity
* sale events
* promotion budget
* portfolio gross
* inventory aging concentration

---

## 6.1 Workflow layer

*Added after the skill-first prototype was built. The layers above are unchanged; this
names the layer between the user and the Skill Router.*

The product is presented as the dealer's jobs, not as the tool's capabilities. Five terms,
used consistently across the interface, the code, and this document:

| Term | Definition | Count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Agent** | Reads a request in the user's own words and directs it. Orchestrates; never computes (§4.1). | 1 |
| **Workflow** | A job the dealer has. Sequences skills and frames the result. What the navigation is made of. | 4 |
| **Skill** | A reusable capability owning one analysis end to end (§10). Never a navigation entry. | 3 |
| **MCP tool** | A typed adapter over a system of record (§8, §9). | — |
| **Dashboard** | A view rendering a finished result. Never calculates. | — |

The four workflows:

| Workflow | Question it answers | Skills used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Acquire Inventory** | What can the lot absorb before buying more? Capacity, gaps, open slots, aging and replacement pressure. | portfolio forecast |
| **Price Inventory** | What is this vehicle worth, what should it be listed at, and what floor constrains it? | single-vehicle valuation |
| **Merchandise Inventory** | Which vehicles to discount for an event, by how much, and is the target reachable? | promotion planner |
| **Improve Aging Inventory** | What should be done about the aged units? | all three |

**Acquire Inventory does not evaluate an external acquisition candidate.** It answers what
the lot can absorb, from the inventory the dealer already has. Appraising a specific
prospective purchase would require a valuation of a vehicle not in inventory and an
acquisition-cost source; neither is in MVP scope (§5.2).

**Improve Aging Inventory is a workflow, not a fourth skill.** It coordinates the three
existing skills against aged units and introduces no valuation, forecasting, or promotion
arithmetic of its own. §28's prohibition on reimplementing a calculation is the reason: a
fourth skill would have duplicated all three.

Navigation is declared as data in one registry module rather than implied by filenames, so
the vocabulary in this section and the vocabulary on screen cannot drift apart.

### Implementation status

The workflow layer is built out across phases; the interface states plainly what is and is
not connected.

* **Deterministic natural-language routing** (§7.1) is connected as of Phase 4 — the
  assistant classifies a request, resolves the vehicle, and runs one skill, with **no model**
  in the path. LLM-assisted routing will sit above this deterministic layer in a later phase.
* **Improve Aging orchestration** is connected as of Phase 5. It coordinates all three skills
  — portfolio forecast → candidate selection → single-vehicle valuation for the aged cohort →
  promotion plan when a real event is named → one consolidated action plan — and adds no
  arithmetic of its own. Figures from different simulations are shown side by side, never
  summed. See `docs/improve-aging-orchestration-results.md`.

# 7. Main Agent Responsibilities

Create a main agent named:

`used-vehicle-pricing-agent`

The main agent must:

1. Understand the user's natural-language request.
2. Identify the requested workflow.
3. Extract required entities and objectives.
4. Produce validated JSON.
5. Select the correct skill.
6. Call the required MCP tools.
7. Detect missing, ambiguous, or stale data.
8. Apply fail-safe policies.
9. Present results in user-friendly language.
10. Preserve structured output and audit metadata.
11. Require confirmation before any write action.

## 7.1 Intent routing

The main agent must route requests as follows:

### Single-vehicle analysis

Examples:

* "What is this vehicle worth?"
* "How much can I discount this RAV4?"
* "How long will this vehicle take to sell?"
* "What is my break-even price?"

Route to:
`single-vehicle-valuation`

### Portfolio analysis

Examples:

* "What is my total inventory worth?"
* "How much revenue will I make next month?"
* "How much should I expect to sell in 90 days?"
* "Which vehicles are creating the greatest aging risk?"

Route to:
`inventory-portfolio-forecast`

### Promotion planning

Examples:

* "Create a July 4th promotion plan."
* "I need to reduce inventory utilization to 70 percent."
* "Which cars should I discount for Christmas?"
* "How much promotion budget is required to clear 25 vehicles?"

Route to:
`dealer-event-promotion-planner`

---

# 8. vAuto MCP Integration

## 8.1 Integration assumption

The vAuto MCP described in this specification is a proposed authorized integration layer.

It may be implemented through:

* vAuto-supported APIs
* Cox Automotive internal services
* dealer-authorized data exports
* enterprise integration middleware
* a custom MCP adapter around authorized vAuto capabilities

The system must not assume that all listed tools currently exist as publicly available vAuto APIs.
For the prototype, use mocked vAuto MCP responses.

## 8.2 vAuto MCP responsibilities

vAuto MCP should provide authorized access to:

* dealer vehicle inventory
* current list prices
* market position
* deal rating
* comparable vehicles
* inventory age
* price history
* market supply
* pricing recommendations
* sales velocity indicators
* shopper engagement, when available

vAuto MCP should not be responsible for:

* interpreting free-form user input
* calculating dealer-specific acquisition cost
* calculating dealer-specific break-even
* determining dealer policy floors
* approving pricing exceptions
* publishing prices without approval

---

# 9. Proposed vAuto MCP Tool Contracts

---

# 11. Shared Data Definitions

## 11.1 Current list price

The advertised vehicle price currently displayed by the dealer.

## 11.2 Transaction price

The expected final selling price after negotiation, promotion, incentive, or markdown.

## 11.3 Market value

A market-supported estimate based on valuation sources and comparable vehicles.

## 11.4 Cost basis

The dealer's invested cost:

```text
Acquisition
+ Transportation
+ Reconditioning
+ Other capitalized vehicle costs
```

## 11.5 Front-end gross

```text
Transaction price
- Acquisition cost
- Reconditioning cost
- Transportation cost
- Direct selling costs
```

## 11.6 Net economic value

```text
Front-end gross
- Cash holding cost
- Depreciation loss
- Promotion cost
- Slot opportunity cost
```

Cash holding cost and slot opportunity cost are two distinct fields defined in §17.
Slot opportunity cost is an imputed economic cost. It appears in net economic value and
in promotion candidate ranking only. It must never enter break-even, minimum safe
transaction price, or any §19.1 publication bar.

## 11.7 Current accounting break-even

The minimum transaction price required to recover costs already incurred or contractually committed as of today.

## 11.8 Projected break-even

The transaction price required to recover current costs plus expected future costs until sale.

## 11.9 Policy price floor

The minimum price permitted under dealer policy.

## 11.10 Minimum safe transaction price

The highest applicable minimum among:

* accounting break-even
* policy floor
* financing constraint
* configured risk floor

## 11.11 Minimum safe list price

The list price required to preserve the minimum safe transaction price after expected discounting.

## 11.12 Promotional headroom

```text
Current or recommended list price
- Minimum safe promotional list price
```

---

# 12. Forecast Percentile Definitions

## 12.1 P50 additional days to sale

There is a 50 percent estimated probability that the vehicle will sell within this number of additional days.

## 12.2 P90 additional days to sale

There is a 90 percent estimated probability that the vehicle will sell within this number of additional days.

Normally:

```text
P90 days to sale ≥ P50 days to sale
```

## 12.3 Projected total inventory age

```text
Current days in inventory
+ Predicted additional days to sale
```

## 12.4 Transaction-price percentiles

P50 transaction price represents the median modeled transaction price.
P90 transaction price means that 90 percent of modeled transaction prices are at or below that value.

For downside risk, P10 transaction price is normally more important than P90.

## 12.5 Joint-distribution warning

The system must not imply that:

* P90 transaction price
* P90 days to sale
* P90 holding cost

necessarily occur in the same simulated scenario.

Where possible, preserve joint simulation records.

# 15. Skill 3: Dealer Event Promotion Planner

Create:
`skills/dealer-event-promotion-planner/SKILL.md`

## 15.1 Purpose

Create a portfolio-level promotion plan that identifies:

* how many vehicles must be sold
* whether the target is achievable
* which vehicles should be promoted
* which vehicles should protect price
* maximum safe discount per vehicle
* recommended event price
* expected event sales
* ending inventory
* target-achievement probability
* gross impact
* capacity impact

## 15.2 Supported request example

> We have a July 4th sales event starting in two days. I want inventory utilization to reach 70 percent by the end of the event. Determine which vehicles should be discounted, how much promotional room each has, and whether the plan will achieve the target.

The agent must resolve exact dates through the event calendar or explicit user input.

## 15.4 Inventory reduction requirement

Calculate:

```text
Target ending inventory
=
Total capacity × target utilization
```

```text
Projected inventory without promotion
=
Current inventory
+ Confirmed inbound
- Baseline expected sales
- Other expected exits
```

```text
Incremental promotional sales required
=
Projected inventory without promotion
- Target ending inventory
```

## 15.5 Promotion candidate evaluation

* conservative achievable units
* event duration
* historical event lift
* target-achievement probability
* feasibility status

If the target is unrealistic, recommend combinations of:

* longer campaign
* revised utilization target
* additional promotion budget
* wholesale disposition
* reduced inbound
* manager-approved loss minimization

# 16. Sales Outcome Model

## 16.1 Production direction

The production sales model may use:

* survival analysis
* gradient-boosted trees
* probabilistic regression
* time-to-event modeling
* calibrated ensemble methods

Survival analysis is appropriate because unsold vehicles create censored observations.

## 16.2 MVP approach

Use a configurable simulation model based on:

* base market days to sale
* price-to-market ratio
* vehicle age
* mileage
* condition
* local supply
* historical sales velocity
* shopper engagement
* dealer performance
* sale-event lift
* seasonality

The MVP must be labeled:
`CONFIGURABLE_PROTOTYPE_SIMULATION`

It must not be represented as a trained production prediction.

---

# 17. Holding Cost Model

Holding cost is reported as two separate quantities. They must not be summed into a
single field.

## 17.1 Cash holding cost

Out-of-pocket or accrued accounting cost.

```text
Daily cash holding cost
=
Floorplan interest
+ Lot allocation
+ Insurance allocation
+ Maintenance
+ Administrative cost
```

## 17.2 Slot opportunity cost

Imputed economic cost of occupying a finite inventory slot. Configurable as the
expected daily net economic value of a replacement vehicle in the same slot.

## 17.3 Usage rule

| Quantity | Cash holding cost | Slot opportunity cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Break-even (§11.7, §11.8) | included | **excluded** |
| Minimum safe transaction price (§11.10) | included | **excluded** |
| §19.1 publication bars | included | **excluded** |
| Net economic value (§11.6) | included | included |
| Promotion candidate ranking (§15.5) | included | included |

Including an imputed cost in a price floor would block sales that are profitable in
accounting terms. The separation is a financial-safety requirement, not a presentation
choice.

## 17.4 Return

* daily cash holding cost
* monthly cash holding cost
* cash holding cost through P50 sale date
* cash holding cost through P90 sale date
* daily slot opportunity cost
* slot opportunity cost through P50 sale date
* slot opportunity cost through P90 sale date
* cost breakdown by component

---

# 18. Depreciation Model

For the prototype:

```text
Future market value
=
Current market value
× (1 - monthly depreciation rate)^(days to sale / 30)
```

Rates must be configurable by:

* segment
* powertrain
* vehicle age
* mileage
* market trend

Return:

* P50 future value
* P90 future value
* P50 depreciation loss
* P90 depreciation loss

---

# 19. Break-Even and Price-Floor Policy

## 19.1 Normal rule

A price may not be published when:

* expected transaction price is below the hard floor
* expected P50 transaction price is below current accounting break-even
* promotion price exceeds available safe headroom
* discount is likely to create negative net value above the configured threshold

## 19.2 Loss-minimization exception

Allow only with:

* manager approval
* documented reason
* immediate loss
* expected future loss
* expected holding cost
* expected depreciation
* capacity opportunity cost
* complete audit trail

| Event calendar        |                 24 hours |
| Historical model data | model-version controlled |

Stale critical data must block price publication.

# 27. MVP Definition of Done

The MVP is complete when:

1. Natural-language requests are converted to schema-valid JSON.
2. The main agent routes requests to the correct skill.
3. Mocked vAuto MCP tools return deterministic test data.
4. Single-vehicle analysis returns valuation, P50/P90 time, financial analysis, and pricing headroom.
5. Portfolio analysis returns current valuation and 30-day/90-day forecasts.
6. Promotion planning returns three portfolio plans.
7. Break-even fail-safe rules are enforced.
8. Aging and depreciation warnings are generated.
9. No numerical price is generated directly by the LLM.
10. No price can be published without confirmation.
11. All recommendations include source, confidence, version, and timestamp.
12. All critical business rules have automated tests.
13. The UI clearly distinguishes prototype assumptions from production predictions.
14. A five-minute end-to-end demonstration can be completed using synthetic data.

# 28. Claude Code Implementation Instruction

Before writing application code:

1. Create this specification as `docs/product-spec.md`.
2. Create `docs/architecture.md`.
3. Create `docs/vauto-mcp-contract.md`.
4. Create the three Skill files.
5. Create all JSON schemas.
6. Create mocked vAuto MCP tool contracts.
7. Create synthetic test scenarios.
8. Identify unresolved assumptions and missing data.
9. Run schema validation.
10. Do not build the UI until the skill boundaries, schemas, and MCP contracts are internally consistent.

The implementation must reuse shared vehicle-level calculation modules across all skills.

The portfolio and promotion skills must not independently reimplement:

* valuation
* break-even analysis
* depreciation
* holding cost
* sales-outcome prediction
* warning policies

All prototype numerical assumptions must be centralized in configurable files rather than distributed as hard-coded constants.
